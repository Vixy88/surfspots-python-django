<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Python REST API built with Django

# Hey, I'm Michael!

I work as a Junior Developer and have recently been taking the Full Stack Software Engineering course with General Assembly in London!

As part of that course, in our final module we have been working with Python to learn about building our own API's with SQL databases. This repo is centered around building a simple API that has a database of surf spots around the world. üèÑüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üåû üåä

We will start with Portugal! üáµüáπ

The next phase will be to connect the Python backend to a React frontend that gives users the ability to find surf spots near them or near a postcode of their choosing.
